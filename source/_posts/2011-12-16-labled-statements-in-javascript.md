### Background
A few months back I was reading the [MooTools](http://mootools.net) project [slick.js](https://github.com/mootools/slick) and I saw some [bit of code](https://github.com/mootools/slick/blob/master/Source/Slick.Finder.js#L277) that I was sure would cause a syntax error.  

`simpleSelectors: if (simpleSelector) {â€¦}`
